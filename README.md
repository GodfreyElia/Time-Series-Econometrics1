### 1. Introduction

Nickel and copper are highly important metals that play a pivotal role in sustaining the global economy mostly due to their multi-faceted applications in construction, electronics and transportation industries. Economists closely monitor the prices of copper and nickel for signs of health of the economy. Thus, in this project, I set out to apply time series econometrics tools to investigate how the prices of the two metals are related.

### 2. Data and Methodology

For this project, I use nickel and copper global price data obtained from FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data). The data is seasonally unadjusted quartely data spanning from 1990 to 2023.

See table below for the summary statistics of the data:
